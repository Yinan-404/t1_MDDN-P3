        <h3 name="q1">What is Grids？</h3>
        <p>Grids is a website for people to store their vital and meaningful objects standing for one period of
          impressive memory in case of loss or forgetin the future. The objects could be a counterfoil of an opera
          people watched with their family, or a sculpture made by themselves to celebrate for one's wedding anniversary.
          It even can be a room. We also accept 3d video recording and the memory extract.</p>

        <h3 name="q2">Why do you need Grids？</h3>
        <h3>-------To Remember!</h3>
        <p>You may be fully aware of the limited performance of human's hippocampus and the unpredictable changes in life.
          With time flies, things important might be lost because of accident or moving house. Sometimes you have to throw something away because
          there isn't enough space at home. To avoid never seeing them, you can upload them on Grids as a backup, as a copy.</p>
	    <p>We also have collaborations with museums all aroung the world, documenting all the precious cutural relics. For those who are looking for reference for art creating, what ever writing or painting, you can find the most true and vivid models in our library that is open to public. Architectures, sculptures, antique furnitures... Just take a look!</p>

        <h3 name="q3">Why should you use Grids instead of traditional social media to record?</h3>
        <p>The difference between traditional social media and Grids is that the Grids uses 3D tech to record and save staffs.
          People can drag the model to see its full appearance. Instead of simple 2D images, this form can record more comprehensicely
          including sound and changing process. For example, if an antique gramophone is scanned and recorded, the user can see
          how the gramophone playing music and the scene it spinning around.</p>

        <h3 name="q4">How do we use Grids?</h3>
        <p>Bring your staff, go to the nearst station, scann it, and upload. If there are plenty of things need to be scanned and upload,
          we provide on-the-spot service.

          It is not poised on the tip of your tongue,<br>

          Who have even forgotten how to swim and how to ride a bicycle.</p>
